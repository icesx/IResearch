Speed
Run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk.

Apache Spark has an advanced DAG execution engine that supports acyclic data flow and in-memory computing.

Ease of Use
Write applications quickly in Java, Scala, Python, R.

Spark offers over 80 high-level operators that make it easy to build parallel apps. And you can use it interactively from the Scala, Python and R shells.

text_file = spark.textFile("hdfs://...")
 
text_file.flatMap(lambda line: line.split())
    .map(lambda word: (word, 1))
    .reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a+b)

Generality
Combine SQL, streaming, and complex analytics.

Spark powers a stack of libraries including SQL and DataFrames, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX, and Spark Streaming. You can combine these libraries seamlessly in the same application.


Runs Everywhere
Spark runs on Hadoop, Mesos, standalone, or in the cloud. It can access diverse data sources including HDFS, Cassandra, HBase, and S3.
